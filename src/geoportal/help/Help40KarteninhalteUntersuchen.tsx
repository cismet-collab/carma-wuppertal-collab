          The aircar rocketed them at speeds in excess of R17 through the steel 
          tunnels that lead out onto the appalling surface of the planet which was 
          now in the grip of yet another drear morning twilight. Ghastly grey lights 
          congealed on the land. R is a velocity measure, defined as a reasonable speed 
          of travel that is consistent with health, mental wellbeing and not being more 
          than say five minutes late. It is therefore clearly an almost infinitely variable 
          figure according to circumstances, since the first two factors vary not only with 
          speed taken as an absolute, but also with awareness of the third factor. Unless 
          handled with tranquility this equation can result in considerable stress, ulcers 
          and even death. R17 is not a fixed velocity, but it is clearly far too fast.
